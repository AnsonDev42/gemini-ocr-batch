## Agent rules
- Run all python related command, start with `uv run python`, as we use uv as package manager;`python xxx` wouldn't work as it's not registered with the installed packages.
- Write all tests using Pytest, mock deps if needed using unittest
- Build Project with production-ready code quality, that is, using best practice to organize, write and test code.
